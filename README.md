## README

<b>Title</b>: FarmFind

<b>Description</b>:

As a dynamic web application, <i>FarmFind</i> displays an interactive map and facets which allow users to filter farmers markets in Prince George's County, Maryland based on a variety of characteristics (e.g., payment methods offered, goods offered). In doing so, <i>FarmFind</i> leverages an API endpoint from <a href = "https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/">Data Prince George's</a> to provide an accessible interface for identifying and locating farmers markets in the area. In 2013, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) categorized Prince George’s County as an area consisting of a large number of “food deserts” — geographic areas that lack healthy, affordable food options. Although <i>FarmFind</i> does not resolve this difficult issue, it may serve as a building-block of future applications geared toward the amerlioration of food desert conditions in the county.
